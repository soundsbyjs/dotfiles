# Juno's Dotfiles 

Dotfiles and other configs for various penguin's tools in a simple, symlinkable format.

Keep them all in once place and symlink them where they go, deploy on a new system for superfluidity!

# Notes:

<h2> vim </h2>

This is my editor and IDE. It has configs for various things.
Requires installation of vim plug, as well as

```pipipippppip pip install neovim
```
<h2> newsboat </h2>

newsboat is an RSS reader. I have some vim bindings configured in .newsboat/config and some cool rss feeds about hacker news and other tech stuff in it. 

# alacritty 

Alacritty moved from alacritty.yml to alacritty.toml for some reason.
