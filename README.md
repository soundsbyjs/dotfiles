# Juno's Dotfiles 

Dotfiles and other configs for various Linux tools in a simple, symlinkable format.

Keep them all in once place and symlink them where they go.

# Notes:

<h2> i3 and i3blocks </h2>

both of these files need to be renamed to "config" when symlinked into their .config folders

<h2> TODO: </h2>

Thinking about creating a script that symlinks things where they go, possibly automate the ENTIRE installation process.
