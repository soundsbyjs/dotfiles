# Juno's Dotfiles 
Dotfiles and other configs for various Linux tools in a simple, symlinkable format.
Have fun. If you don't know what you're doing with these then don't do anything with them?

# notes:

<h2> i3 and i3blocks </h2>

both of these files need to be renamed to "config" when symlinked into their .config folders
