# Juno's Dotfiles 

Dotfiles and other configs for various penguin's tools in a simple, symlinkable format.

Keep them all in once place and symlink them where they go, deploy on a new system for superfluidity!

# Notes:

<h2> i3 and i3blocks </h2>

both of these files need to be renamed to "config" when symlinked into their .config folders
